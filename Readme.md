Help Center Application
Overview
This is a full-stack Help Center application built using React for the frontend and Node.js/Express for the backend. The app allows users to search for help topics and display information fetched from a backend API.

Project Structure
Frontend (React)
HelpCenter.jsx: The main component that handles displaying help center data and a search feature.
HelpCenter.css: Styling for the Help Center component.
Backend (Node.js/Express)
server.js: The Express server that provides an API endpoint for fetching help center data.
Features
Display help center topics with titles and descriptions.
Search functionality to filter topics by title or description.
Data fetched from a backend API.
Responsive design for various screen sizes.
Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v12.x or later)
npm (v6.x or later)
Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory: If your backend and frontend are in different directories, navigate to the backend directory.

Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the Server:

bash
Copy code
node server.js
The server will run on http://localhost:5000 by default.

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory: If your frontend and backend are in different directories, navigate to the frontend directory.

Install Dependencies:

bash
Copy code
npm install
Run the React App:

bash
Copy code
npm start
The React app will run on http://localhost:3000 by default.

API Endpoint
The API endpoint to fetch help center data is:
scss
Copy code
GET /api/help-center-data
Usage
Start the backend server using the instructions provided above.
Start the React application.
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
The Help Center page will display a search bar and a list of help center topics.
Use the search bar to filter topics by title or description.
Troubleshooting
404 Not Found Error:
Ensure that the backend server is running on the correct port and the API endpoint is correctly defined in both the server.js file and the frontend HelpCenter.jsx file.
CORS Issues:
The backend server uses the cors package to handle CORS issues. If the frontend still faces CORS issues, ensure that the cors middleware is correctly applied in server.js.
Future Improvements
Add authentication and authorization features.
Implement pagination for large datasets.
Add more advanced search filters (e.g., by category).
Create a database to persist help center data instead of using an in-memory array.
